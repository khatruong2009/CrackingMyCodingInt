## String Data Structure

How to declare a string in python:
x = "huzzah"

Arrays of bytes representing unicode characters. Characters don't exist in Python, so it's a string with a length of one.

Accessing individual characters can be done by reference to the index value.
	- ex: -1 is the last character
x = "huzzah"
print(x[-1]) would give me 'h'
